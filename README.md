## Project Description

In this project, I created visualizations to reveal insights from Youtube (US) dataset. 
My visualizations tell a story and highlights patterns in the data set while reflecting the theory and practice of data visualization, 
such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication.

## Project Overview

### Background:

YouTube (the world-famous video sharing website) maintains a list of the top trending videos on the platform. To determine the year’s top-trending videos, YouTube uses a combination of metrics measuring users interactions, including: number of views, shares, comments and likes.
This data comes from a Kaggle dataset, it includes a bunch of information for videos that were trending for several months (November,2017 – March,2018) mainly in USA.

### Problem description:

AS a data analyst, I'm conducting an exploratory data analysis (EDA) providing variety of insights to answer the following questions:

#### 1. What categories are the most liked and disliked ? Were there outliers channels or titles for these categories ?
#### 2. Perhaps there is a time of year where one category is preferred ?
#### 3. Channel Distribution: Which location exhibits the greatest channel presence ?
#### 4. What tags have grown in popularity over time ?
#### 5. Analyzing Seasonal Trends: Is there a peak time for a specific tag ?
#### 6. Popular tags and location correlation: Are there distinct regions associated with specific tags ?
